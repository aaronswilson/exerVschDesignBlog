            <p>Working with a lathe can be very helpful when carving round symmetrical objects such as <b>rings</b>, <b>pens</b>, <b>bowls</b>, <b>bats</b>, and <b>many more</b>! It works by rotating the wood piece at various speeds up to 1000 RPM. At these speeds it is possible to carve away at the wood using a chisel like tool designed to chip away at the wood.</p>

            <p>One thing that many people take for granted is the importance of selecting the right piece of wood for any particular project. Important factors to take into account include: <b>color</b>, <b>grain</b>, <b>stainability</b>, and <b>wood density</b> or <b>hardness</b>. Of these characteristics, the hardness of a piece of wood is most often taken for granted. The Janka scale is a measurement of how much force is required to push a steel ball into a piece of wood to a desired depth. This information can be used to estimate how difficult it might be to cut or sand various types of wood.</p>
